        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Prawns</li>
            <li>4 lettuce leaves, 1 Cucumber, 2 Lemons</li>
            <li>150 g Wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 egg, 1 glass of milk or water</li>
            <li>10 g Baking powder, 5 pinches Pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white wine</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the flour, baking powder, pepper and egg. Mix gently to obtain a homogeneous mixture then add the milk. Beat everything with a whisk or an electric mixer until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes in a cool, dry place.</li>
            <li>While the dough is resting, take care of the shrimp. Shell them taking care to leave the tail.</li>
            <li>Rinse the shrimp with water and wipe it off with a paper towel type towel.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, pour the ingredients for the marinade and mix everything with a fork. Then place the shrimp in it and let them soak, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, cut the lettuce leaves into small pieces and cut the cucumber into rings. Then place them on a plate or serving platter as you like.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan or wok, heat the oil to 180 Â° C</li>
            <li>Remove the shrimp from the marinade (which you can then discard) and dip them in the dough, holding them by the tail.</li>
            <li>After dropping the excess dough, immerse them in boiling oil to fry.</li>
            <li>When the color of the fritters are golden, remove them using chopsticks or a skimmer, being careful not to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>Drain the shrimp using a paper towel. Enjoy!</li>
